// RAID Descriptions

"raid6_description" = "RAID 6 (Striping with Dual Parity) similar to RAID 5 but with two parity sets. Can survive two simultaneous drive failures.";

"jbod_description" = "JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks) combines multiple drives as one large volume without any RAID features. Each drive operates independently.";

// RAID Pros
"raid0_pros" = "Maximum performance and speed\nFull storage capacity utilization\nSimple to implement";

// RAID Cons
"raid0_cons" = "No data redundancy or protection\nSingle drive failure causes complete data loss\nNot suitable for critical data";
"raid1_cons" = "50%% storage capacity efficiency\nHigher cost per usable GB\nWrite performance similar to single drive";
"raid5_cons" = "Slower write performance due to parity calculation\nRebuild can be slow with large drives\nRisk of data loss during rebuild if another drive fails";
"raid6_cons" = "Higher capacity overhead than RAID 5\nSlower write performance than RAID 5\nMore complex implementation";
"raid10_cons" = "50%% storage capacity efficiency\nRequires even number of drives (minimum 4)\nHigher cost per usable GB";
"jbod_cons" = "No redundancy or data protection\nDrive failure affects only data on that drive\nNo performance benefits of striping";
